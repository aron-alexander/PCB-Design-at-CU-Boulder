# PCB-Design-at-CU-Boulder
This repository was made as a way of tracking my progress through the [Practical PCB Design course](https://catalog.colorado.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering-applied-science/programs-study/electrical-computer-energy-engineering/#coursestext:~:text=ECEN%C2%A03730%20(3)%20Practical%20Printed%20Circuit%20Board%20Design%20and%20Manufacture) at CU Boulder during the Fall 2024 semester. The class was originally designed by [Eric Bogatin](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/bogatin/) and taught by Tim Swettlen. Over the course of the semester, I designed four PC boards, each with their own unique challenges and learning goals.

## Board 1: Astable 555 Timer to Drive LEDs
